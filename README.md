# Toyhouse Layouts
A repository to store my public-use layouts for a site called [Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se) where users can create profiles for characters.

## Purpose and Permissions
The purpose of this repository is to better organize and provide the ability for people to view my codes publicly. These codes are made for the invite-only platform [Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se) and users may use them on their characters as long as the credit is kept on the codes. They use HTML, in-line CSS, as well as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) CSS and [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)'s icons. 

I make these as a hobby for people to put their character info in but I believe that they can also be examples of my code. Note that Toyhouse does not allow Javascript for security reasons so certain Bootstrap components do not work and thus are not featured in these layouts. Notably HTML Buttons also do not work so a different attribute is used instead.

## Resources

Relevant Links that may help with understanding the technologies behind these layouts. None of these tools and websites are created by me.

[Toyhou.se](https://toyhou.se)

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

[CircleJourney's Toyhouse Editor](https://th.circlejourney.net/) (This may be used in the case of someone not having an account and wanting to see a preview of the layout. I also recommend using this tool as it provides a live preview as you edit. There can be occassional glitches that are not present when the code is used on-site.)

[Safe-House](https://safehou-se.vercel.app/) (Some of the codes I put in here may be a Safe-House version which allows them to be populated using this website's tool instead of directly in the code.)
